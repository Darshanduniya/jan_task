Business Justification:
Despite having an existing installation of Apache Airflow, the need for a standby instance is justified to ensure continuity and reliability of our data workflows. Having a standby Airflow server provides redundancy and failsafe measures in case the primary server encounters issues such as hardware failure, maintenance downtime, or software glitches. This redundancy is crucial for maintaining uninterrupted data processing operations, especially in environments where data integrity and timeliness are critical for business success. Therefore, investing in a standby Airflow instance aligns with our goal of ensuring operational resilience and minimizing the risk of workflow disruptions.

Risk of Doing This Change:
Introducing a standby Airflow instance entails the risk of additional resource allocation and management overhead. There will be costs associated with provisioning and maintaining the standby server, including hardware, software licenses, and ongoing monitoring. Moreover, ensuring synchronization and failover mechanisms between the primary and standby instances requires careful configuration and testing to avoid potential inconsistencies or data loss. However, these risks can be mitigated through thorough planning, implementation of best practices for high availability, and regular testing of failover procedures.

Risk of Not Performing This Change:
Without implementing a standby Airflow instance, we expose ourselves to the risk of extended downtime and data processing interruptions in the event of a failure or outage affecting the primary Airflow server. This downtime could disrupt critical business operations, delay data-driven decision-making processes, and potentially result in financial losses or damage to our reputation. Additionally, relying solely on a single Airflow instance increases our vulnerability to unforeseen technical issues or emergencies, which could have far-reaching consequences for our business continuity. Therefore, investing in a standby Airflow instance is essential to mitigate these risks and ensure continuous availability of our data workflows.

Impact on ILD Environment:
Adding a standby Airflow instance will have a minimal impact on the ILD environment, as it serves as a redundant backup rather than a primary component of the workflow infrastructure. The standby instance can be configured to mirror the primary Airflow server's environment, ensuring consistency in workflow definitions and configurations. While there will be additional resource requirements for provisioning and maintaining the standby server, these can be managed within the existing ILD infrastructure without significant disruption. Furthermore, the benefits of having a standby Airflow instance in terms of improved resilience and reliability justify any minor adjustments needed in the ILD environment. Therefore, the impact on the ILD environment is justified by the added assurance of continuous data processing operations provided by the standby Airflow instance
